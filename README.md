# Cexec Task - Custom Execute

This is a simple executor, sometimes the default `exec` task does not work as expected.

I wrote this simple task just to trigger some terminal commands from a gradle task.
It may looks strange if you only know the basic gradle commands.

Try to imagine the following situations:
  * Run something before install the app on android. Like the `development backEnd App`, `mocked Api` or anything like thad.
  * Grab information from the PC to use on the app. When I'm working with both backEnd and Android App,
  I want to use *my pc IP address* as `API_URL` but I don't want to keep looking on my IP address manually.
  So we can use a task to do that for us.

I use the `cexec` task to do those tasks. Keep reading, the `IP Grabber` will have it's own task.
